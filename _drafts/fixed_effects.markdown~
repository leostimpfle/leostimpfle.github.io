Fixed effect models are a popular tool to deal with unobserved heterogeneity.  This post tries to provide a simple illustration of what fixed effects do (and what they don't).

## Background
The linear two-way fixed effects model is

$$y_{it}=\alpha+\beta x_{it}+\nu_i+\tau_t+\epsilon_{it},$$

where $\nu_i$ are individual-fixed effects and $\tau_i$ are time-fixed effects. The terminology refers to the heterogeneity being a *fixed* intercept at the level of individuals $\nu_i$ or times $\tau_t$.

The two-way fixed effects estimator is 

$$\hat{\beta} = \arg\min_{\beta}\Bigl[
	\Bigl(
	\bigl(
		y_{it} - \bar{y}_i - \bar{y}_t + \bar{y}
	\bigr)
	-\beta\bigl(
		x_{it} - \bar{x}_i - \bar{x}_t + \bar{x}
	\bigr)
	\Bigr)^2
\Bigr],$$

where
- $\bar{y}=\frac{1}{NT}\sum_{i=i_1}^{i_N}\sum_{t=t_1}^{t_T}y_{it}$ is the sample mean,
- $$\bar{y}_t = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=i_1}^{i_N}y_{it}$$ is the mean across individuals at time $t$,
- $$\bar{y}_i=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=t_1}^{t_T}y_{it}$$ is the mean for indiviudal $i$ across all times.

### Within and Between Variation

## Illustration

Let's illustrate a simple fixed effects model with synthetic data.  Consider a population of individuals characterised by a dummy variable $\verb\|property_dummy\|$ indicating exposure to a treatment that occurs in $t=2017$.  For each individual $i$, we then create a time series of observations that follows a linear two-way fixed effects model:

$$
y_{it} = \verb|property_dummy|_i*\delta_t^{2017} + \nu_i + \tau_t + \epsilon_{it},\text{ where }\delta^{2017}_i=\begin{cases}1,&\text{if }t=2017,\\0,&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}
$$

### POLS
Applying pooled ordinary least squares (POLS) to this kind of data is bound to fail because of the unobserved individual or time fixed heterogeneity in the data (namely, $\nu_i$ and $\tau_t$).  POLS estimates the effect of the treatment by the difference in averages of the dependent variable with and without treatment:
